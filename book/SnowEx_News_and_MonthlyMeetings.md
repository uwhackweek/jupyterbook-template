	* This Google Doc contains links to the media videos, articles and blogs about SnowEx, highlighting many different components and groups.  In addition, the links to the recordings from the SnowEx Community meetings are at the bottom of this file - many presentations have been given on the datasets collected and published at NSIDC.
  
To Do: This should be cleaned up and put in markdown, with links.  Adding the agenda to each community meeting link would help people navigate to datasets of interest.
