## **Project ideation and team formation**

Though project ideation begins well before the hackweek event, it is expected that the process is ongoing and iterative, and will continue through the event itself with input from participants helping to shape or adapt project goals.

### Before the event

We invite those who are interested in leading a project to join our organizing team in the months before the hackweek. At a first kick-off meeting, project leads will be guided through brainstorming, identifying overlaps or connections between project ideas, and identifying common needs in hackweek tutorial content that will help projects be successful. After this initial meeting, project leads will work on defining their project by creating a github repository from the project template, defining project tasks, and outlining the anticipated skills that participants will apply in the project. This is all information that hackweek participants will be using to help them select a project team to join.

At a second meeting, project leads will again share their projects with one another. This gives them an opportunity to solicit feedback on the feasibility of the project scope, or raise any questions. During this meeting hackweek organizers will present information on how to effectively lead a group project, and guide the project leads through some activities to practice those skills. 

Around the time of the second meeting, hackweek participants will be browsing all of the project repositories, chatting with project leads on slack, and may begin selecting which one they would like to work on. Throughout the process, hackweek organizers will be available to answer questions and to help participants get connected with a project that fits their learning objectives.


### Day 1 of the event

We facilitate a project team formation session on the first day of the hackweek. During this time we will finalize project goals and objectives. Hackweek organizers and facilitators will help each team set reasonable goals and develop a roadmap for task completion.

* [x] The first team meeting focuses on hearing from each team member:
    * [x] What are your unique learning goals? 
    * [x] How do you work best? What level of group interaction works for you?
    * [x] What skills and background are you most excited to share with the team?
    * [x] When are you available to meet?
* [x] This is also a good time to review the [code of conduct](../CoC.md) and discuss as a team:
    * [x] How is the team going to communicate?
    * [x] How is the team going to discuss ideas and make decisions?
    * [x] How are tasks going to be assigned?
* [x] Identify connections between each participant's personal goals and the specific project tasks
* [x] Set up team organization infrastructure on Slack and GitHub (see [Project Initialization](project_initialization)) 
* [x] Project work begins!
    * [x] As progress is made, project outputs (code, notebooks, figures, documentation, etc.) are recorded in the team's GitHub repository
* [x] All team members check back in at the end of the day, review progress towards tasks, anything preventing progress, and planned next steps

## **Project teamwork**

During the hackweek, participants will spend time with tutorials and with project work. The following is a suggested outline for daily check-in meetings. On the final day of the event, teams will want to set aside some time to gather material that they would like to share with the entire group to showcase what they worked on.

### Days 2 - 4: Project work

* [x] Begin each day with a team meeting to discuss:
    * [x] Progress made on the previous day
    * [x] Anything preventing progress
    * [x] Tasks for this day
* [x] Check back in at the end of the day:
    * [x] Progress made today
    * [x] Anything preventing progress
    * [x] Planned next steps for tomorrow

### Day 5: Sharing results

* [x] Begin the day with a team meeting to discuss:
    * [x] Progress made on the previous day
    * [x] Anything preventing progress
    * [x] Tasks for this day
    * [x] Decide what time to stop work and organize material to present
* [x] Organize material to present (push changes to repository, update README, etc.)
* [x] Each team will have about 15 minutes to present all the things you did and learned during the week, recognize and celebrate individual contributions to the group effort, what challenges arose, what might be worth trying next

## **Communities of practice**

### After the event

* We aspire to keep projects going after the hackweek! This is an optional (ideal) outcome of hackweek project work.
* Project leads/helpers will transition to longer-term engagement via mentorship role (optional/with support).
* Additional people join a growing Community of Practice (for example, centered on a community software library).
* Software, research results are packaged and shared/published.
