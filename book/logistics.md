## Travel

* Seattle-Tacoma International Airport offers a range of connections to the
  University of Washington Campus.
* The Link light rail is an easy, great way to get to the UW campus from the
  airport. It picks you up at the airport, comes about every 5-15 minutes, and
  drops you off right on the UW campus; just a 15-minute walk from the dorms you
  will be staying in.
* From the arrivals hall at Sea-Tac Airport, follow the signs for Link Light
  Rail; the station is a short walk from the terminal on the far side of the
  parking garage. Tickets must be purchased at the station before boarding. The
  cost is $3.00 and can be paid in cash or with a credit/debit card. Take the
  northbound train toward Northgate to the University of Washington station (
  Note: do not get off at the University Street Station!).
* Taxi’s and uber/lyft are also available from the airport. Note that for
  uber/lyft you will meet the car in the 3rd floor parking lot for pick up.
* Incurred travel costs for participants provided event support funds will be
  reconciled after the GeoSMART Hackweek event.
