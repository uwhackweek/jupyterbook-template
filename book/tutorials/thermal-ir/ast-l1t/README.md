# ASTER L1T Scripts and Tutorials
This repository contains R and Python scripts for processing the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection  
Radiometer (ASTER) Level 1 Precision Terrain Corrected Registered At-Sensor Radiance data product (AST_L1T).   
The scripts repository includes:   
**•	ASTERL1T_hdf2tif:** Use to open Hierarchical Data Format (HDF, .hdf) files and export into GeoTIFFs   
**•	ASTERL1T_DN2REF:** Converting from Digital Numbers (DN) to Top-of-Atmosphere Reflectance   
**•	ASTER_L1T_Tutorial.Rmd:**  Working with ASTER L1T data in R. R markdown file used to generate the R Notebook:  
[Working with ASTER L1T Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR) Data in R](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/public/elearning/ASTER_L1T_Tutorial.html).  

For information on the prerequisites and procedures for any of the ASTER L1T scripts, find the link to the specific  
tool that you are interested in below.
