    "One key feature LIS provides is flexibility to meet user needs. LIS consists of a collection of plug-ins, or modules, that allow users to design simulations with their choice of land surface model, meteorological forcing, data assimilation, hydrological routing, land surface parameters, and more. The plug-in based design also provides extensibility, making it easier to add new functionality to the LIS framework.\n",

    "Current efforts to expand support for snow modeling include implementation of snow modules, such as [SnowModel](https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM548.1) and [Crocus](http://www.umr-cnrm.fr/spip.php?article265&lang=en), into the LIS framework. These models, when run at the scale of ~100 meters, will enable simulation of wind redistribution, snow grain size, and other important processes for more accurate snow modeling.\n",

In this tutorial we will be using outputs originally generated as NetCDF files that have been converted into a [Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) store. Why Zarr? We've been exploring cloud-based analysis pipelines and Zarr provides better performance when working with cloud-hosted data. More on this later...\n",
