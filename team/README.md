# The team folder

All members of the organizing team should add themselves to the webpage.
This folder contains a file for each person describing themselves.

## Adding a new member
Follow these steps to add yourself:
* Navigate to the 'landing page' repository for your event.
* Navigate into the 'teams' directory.
* Use the provided 'template.yaml' file.
* Create a copy of the 'template.yaml' file and rename the file to your name.
In the GitHub interface, you can create a new file and copy-paste from the template.
Or, in a local repository you can do this on the command line with
   ```
    cp template.yaml FirstName-LastName.yaml
   ```
* Open the new file you just created in your favorite editor and fill out the
  details, replacing the placeholder text.
* Commit the file and (if necessary) push your changes to GitHub.
* Open a pull request (PR).
* Don't forget to add a reviewer to the PR so they get notified.
